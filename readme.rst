Tutorial 5 Starter Webapp - Caboose
###################################

This is the starter webapp for CodeIgniter Tutorial #5.

Unlike an earlier version, this version is fully functional, just feature incomplete.

The project uses a "quotes" database, setup through quotes-setup.sql in the project root.

The homepage displays the most recently added quote, with drill-down to see a 
specific quote in detail.

The Viewer controller displays all the quotes on file, by default.
Each mugshot links to a viewer/quote method call, to display that author's quote.
